## What I Worked On  
- Tried to finish what I can for the final website!
- I created the product page
- Added images and edited the font and visual aesthetics of the site the best I could
- Added a horizontal scrolling feature to the home page products

## Challenges I Faced  
I definitely had to simplify my design ALOT. I did come into minor challenges like images not showing up or pages not showing up at all but with a lot of trial and error, I found that most of the time it was because of a very minor mistake like forgetting to put "/" when linking pages. Again, I had to ask ChatGPT for help so that I understood why things were breaking or not working and how to fix it.

## Next Steps  
- Present my final website!
