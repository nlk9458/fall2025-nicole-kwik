## What I Worked On  
- Basically created the browse and product page
- Edited the css of the home page and browse page
- added a search bar

---

## Challenges I Faced  
I had to use a lot of help from ChatGPT just to get the other pages set up and kept running into errors when trying to connect the product cards on the home page to the individual product page. I realized I don't need a profile page for this profile as it isn't super relevant to the overall user flow so i'm going to remove that page.

## Next Steps  
- keep working on the individual product page
- edit the css so its more aesthetically pleasing
- add images to the other product cards
