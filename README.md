Architecture Planning

I chose Option A for now because I think that makes the most sense for my website to have separate pages for each section. My plan is also to create new pages for each product that I want to include in the final prototype. 

For now, the pages my project needs are:
1. Home
2. Browse
3. Profile
4. Specific product pages
Users would navigate through each page through a main navigation bar at the top of the website so that they are easily able to switch between pages. For the product page, users will be able to navigate to a specific one through the home page and the browse page depending on what the user's click. 

Challenges I might anticipate:
I'm a little worried about the product pages just because I'm wondering if there is an easier way than creating multiple spearate pages for each product. As a prototype, it would be fine for me to include a few product pages just to show how it would work in real life. However, I'm trying to think if it was a real project, what would be the best way to approach this? assuming there would be thousands of products on the site.
